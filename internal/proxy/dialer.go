// Package proxy implements the vhost reverse-proxy data plane for Burrow.
//
// It routes HTTPS requests arriving on the shared ingress port to live HTTP
// tunnels by matching the subdomain label against the in-memory tunnel
// registry.
//
// Trust boundary: Burrow is the TLS edge. All inbound X-Forwarded-* and
// Forwarded headers from visitors are stripped and replaced with authoritative
// values set by this proxy.
//
// h2c is explicitly not supported. Any request carrying "Upgrade: h2c" is
// answered with HTTP 505 (HTTP Version Not Supported). This is documented and
// permanent: Burrow's ingress is HTTP/1.1 over TLS; h2c (cleartext HTTP/2
// upgrade) has no place in this stack.
//
// WebSocket upgrades are handled transparently by httputil.ReverseProxy (Go
// ≥ 1.20). No extra code is required; the Upgrade and Connection headers pass
// through to the upstream as-is.
//
// Gate handler: requests to the auth domain under /__burrow/* are dispatched
// to an optional gate http.Handler injected via New. When the gate is nil (the
// default, and for all tests in this package), those requests return 404.
// Task 9 wires the real gate handler.

// Resolved carries the service metadata that the proxy needs after a
// successful Lookup. It is populated by StreamDialer.Lookup and threaded
// through the access checker before any stream is opened.
//
// Fields:
//   - ServiceID: stable service identity (matches store.Service.ID).
//   - AccessMode: one of "open", "api_key", "burrow_login", or "mtls".
//   - APIKeyHeader: name of the HTTP header the upstream uses for its API key
//     (only meaningful when AccessMode == "api_key").
//   - LocalHost: the Host header and URL host to use when forwarding to the
//     upstream. Typically the host part of the tunnel's LocalAddr
//     (e.g. "127.0.0.1" for "127.0.0.1:3000"). When empty the proxy falls
//     back to the tunnel's full LocalAddr string.
//   - MTLSCAPEM: operator-supplied PEM-encoded CA bundle used to verify the
//     visitor's client certificate. Required when AccessMode == "mtls"; the
//     PUT /access-mode handler refuses an mtls switch without a non-empty
//     CA. Burrow does NOT sign client certs — the operator brings their
//     own PKI.

// StreamDialer is the interface that the proxy uses to:

//     called only after access has been granted, once per proxied request.

// The concrete implementation (a proxyDialerAdapter wrapping *server.Server)
// is wired in Task 12. Tests use a fake backed by net.Pipe().
