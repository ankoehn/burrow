# Burrow

> Self-hosted reverse tunnels — expose a local port through a relay you run yourself. One server binary, one client binary, one public URL. Apache-2.0, no held-back features.

## Status

**v0.1 — MVP, working end to end.** Burrow tunnels TCP today: a TLS-authenticated control plane, a TCP data plane, database-backed token auth, an HTTP/JSON API, and a web dashboard embedded in the server binary. You can self-host the relay on a VPS and expose a local service in a couple of minutes.

This is **early software**: single-admin, TCP only, expect rough edges and breaking changes before v1.0. It works and it is honest about what it is — it is not yet battle-tested in production.

## Why Burrow

- **Self-hosted, no SaaS.** The relay runs on your server. No third party sees your traffic, no account, no limits you didn't set.
- **Apache-2.0, no open core.** Every feature is in this repository. Nothing is held back for a paid tier.
- **Two static binaries.** `burrowd` (server) and `burrow` (client). No runtime, no `docker compose` of seven services. Pure Go, cross-compiled for Linux, macOS, and Windows with no CGO.
- **Batteries included.** A real embedded web dashboard, token auth, a JSON API, and live per-tunnel byte counters — not just a port forwarder.

## Quickstart

You need a host with a public IP (the relay) and the machine running the service you want to expose.

**1. Run the relay** on your VPS. This generates self-signed dev TLS certs into `./certs`, seeds the admin user, serves the dashboard + API on `:8080`, and the control channel on `:7000`:

```bash
BURROW_ADMIN_EMAIL=you@example.com BURROW_ADMIN_PASSWORD=pick-a-strong-password \
  burrowd serve --dev-certs
```

**2. Create a tunnel token.** Open `http://<your-vps>:8080`, log in with the admin credentials from step 1, and create a token — copy the `bur_…` value. *(No browser handy? On the VPS, after the relay has started once, run `burrowd token --email you@example.com` and copy the printed token.)*

**3. Expose your local service** from your machine. This publishes `127.0.0.1:3000` on the relay's port `9000`:

```bash
burrow connect --server <your-vps>:7000 --token bur_xxx \
  --local 127.0.0.1:3000 --remote 9000 --insecure
```

`--dev-certs` issues a self-signed certificate valid only for `localhost`/`127.0.0.1`, so reaching a VPS by its hostname requires `--insecure` (skip TLS verification — fine for trying Burrow, **never in production**). Omit `--remote` to let the server pick a free port (9000–9100 by default). Visitors now reach your service at `<your-vps>:9000`.

**For production, use real TLS certificates.** Set `BURROW_TLS_CERT` / `BURROW_TLS_KEY` (a certificate whose SAN includes your server's hostname) instead of `--dev-certs`; then drop `--insecure` and instead pass `--cacert <your-ca.pem>` (omit if the cert chains to a public CA) and `--server-name <hostname-in-the-cert>`. Put the dashboard behind HTTPS too.

### Install

Prebuilt binaries for Linux (amd64 / arm64 / armv7), macOS (amd64 / arm64), and Windows (amd64), plus a multi-arch container image, are published on the [Releases](https://github.com/ankoehn/burrow/releases) page for each tagged version. If you cloned `main` before the first release tag, build from source (below).

Docker (`./data` must be writable by the container's non-root user, uid 65532 — e.g. `mkdir -p data && sudo chown 65532:65532 data`):

```bash
docker run -d --name burrow \
  -p 8080:8080 -p 7000:7000 -p 9000-9100:9000-9100 \
  -e BURROW_ADMIN_EMAIL=you@example.com \
  -e BURROW_ADMIN_PASSWORD=pick-a-strong-password \
  -e BURROW_DATABASE_PATH=/data/burrow.db \
  -v "$PWD/data:/data" -w /data \
  ghcr.io/ankoehn/burrow:latest serve --dev-certs
```

Or use the provided [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml).

**Docker/K8s file secrets:** Burrow supports the `BURROW_<VAR>_FILE` convention for any config key. Set `BURROW_ADMIN_PASSWORD_FILE=/run/secrets/admin_pw` (instead of `BURROW_ADMIN_PASSWORD`) and Burrow reads the secret from that file (trailing newline stripped). The `_FILE` value wins if both forms are set; a missing file is a hard error. The provided `docker-compose.yml` includes a working `secrets:` block example.

Build from source (Go 1.25+):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ankoehn/burrow && cd burrow
make build            # or: task build   (Windows / no make)
./bin/burrowd version
./bin/burrow version
```

## Comparison

|  | **Burrow** | frp | ngrok | Pangolin |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Self-hosted relay | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ (hosted SaaS) | ✅ |
| License | Apache-2.0 | Apache-2.0 | Proprietary | AGPL-3.0 |
| Held-back / paid-only features | None | None | Many | Some |
| Deploys as | 2 static binaries | 2 static binaries | client binary + SaaS | container stack |
| Built-in web dashboard | ✅ | ✅ (status page) | ✅ (hosted) | ✅ |
| Protocols | TCP (v0.1) | TCP / HTTP / UDP | TCP / HTTP / TLS | HTTP / TCP + access control |

Burrow is the youngest and narrowest of these — it does one thing (self-hosted TCP tunnels with a clean dashboard) under a permissive license with no held-back features. frp is the closest mature analogue (also Apache-2.0); choose Burrow if you want a smaller surface and a built-in management dashboard, frp if you need HTTP/UDP today.

## Architecture

    subgraph Your machine
      L["Local service\n127.0.0.1:3000"]
      C["burrow (client)"]
    end
    subgraph Your VPS
      S["burrowd (server)"]
      P["Public listener\n:9000"]
      D["Dashboard + JSON API\n:8080"]
    end

    S <-->|"TLS + yamux\ncontrol channel :7000"| C
    C --> L
    A["Admin"] -->|"HTTP — create token\n(one-time setup)"| D
```

The client opens a single outbound TLS connection to the server and authenticates with a token. Control messages are multiplexed over a yamux session; each visitor connection becomes a new stream that the server bridges to the client, which dials your local service. The dashboard and JSON API run inside the same `burrowd` process and mint the token the client uses.

## Roadmap

v0.1 (this release) is the MVP: TLS control plane, TCP data plane, token auth, HTTP/JSON API, embedded dashboard, admin-managed multi-user accounts (with self-service password change), login rate limiting, CSRF protection, native HTTPS/HSTS support, and Docker/K8s `*_FILE` secret support. Likely directions beyond v0.1 (ideas, not commitments): HTTP-aware tunnels with hostname routing and automatic TLS, and further dashboard polish. Tracked deferrals live in [`BACKLOG.md`](BACKLOG.md). Issues and discussion are welcome.
